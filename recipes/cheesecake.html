    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine coconut, gingersnap cookies, and melted butter in a bowl; mix until evenly moistened. Press cookie mixture into
            the bottom and slightly up the sides of the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake crust in the preheated oven until browned and set, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce oven heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            Beat softened cream cheese in a mixing bowl until smooth. With the beater set to medium-low, slowly pour condensed milk
            into the bowl, mixing only until just blended and stopping to scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition; scrape the sides of the bowl as necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour about 1/2 of the cream cheese batter into a separate bowl. Stir lime zest and lime juice into portion in the new
            bowl; pour batter over crust in the springform pan, smoothing into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir coconut extract through remaining cream cheese batter; pour over lime-flavored batter in the springform pan,
            smoothing into an even layer.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until top of cheesecake springs back when gently pressed, about 45 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Turn oven heat off, but leave cheesecake inside with the oven door slightly ajar until the oven cools completely.
            Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare mango coulis by pur√©eing mango with sugar in a blender until smooth. If too thick, add 1 teaspoon water at a
            time, using just enough to make it pourable. Drizzle over cheesecake when plated.
        </li>
    </ol>
